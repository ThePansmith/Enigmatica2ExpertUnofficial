e2eu.quest.db.436.title=Rocket Assembling Machine
e2eu.quest.db.436.desc=The Rocket Assembling Machine is a multiblock structure that will allow you to make Rockets to go into space. This first quest will only detail how to build the structure.%n%nStart by placing Launch Pad blocks in a rectangle on the ground. It can be anywhere from 3x3 to 16x16. On the same level, place a Structure Tower near one of the side, then stack up more of them to make a 1 block tower. This tower can be anywhere from 4 to 64 blocks tall.%n%nFinally, place the Rocket Assembling Machine itself one block above the level of the Pads, with the back of the machine facing the Pad, and plug it with RF. If you did this correctly, it should no longer say "Invalid Launch Pad Structure".%n%nThen you need the Fueling Station to be able to fuel your Rockets. Place it somewhere near the Assembling Machine, plug it with RF and your source of Rocket Fuel, then sneak + right click it with a Linker, then sneak + right click the Assembling Machine with the same Linker.

e2eu.quest.db.437.title=Building a Rocket
e2eu.quest.db.437.desc=Building a Rocket is the last step before getting to space.%n%nThe Rocket needs to be built on your Rocket Assembling Machine, with the Launch Pad blocks delimiting the horizontal space you have and the Structure Tower the vertical space you have (you can't go higher than your stack of Structure Towers and can't go out the rectangle of Launch Pad).%n%nA manned Rocket needs a Guidance Computer, a Seat, at least one Rocket Engine (a better version can be crafted once you got Titanium Iridium Alloy) and at least one Liquid Fuel Tank. There are no other restrictions that apply, your Rocket can be as unrealistic as you want so long that you respect the above points.%n%nTo check if your Rocket is actually capable of reaching space, go on your Rocket Assembling Machine and click Scan. It will both tell you how what's missing as well as various stats, as follow :%n-Thrust : how much thrust the Engines are providing%n-Weight : how heavy is the Rocket, most blocks have the same weight but blocks with inventories can be heavier%n-Fuel : how much fuel capacity you have, increased by adding more Tanks; the white line is the amount required to reach orbit, and thus you should always have more than that%n-Acceleration : how fast will the Rocket accelerate on a planet with as much gravity as the Overworld; white bar in the middle is 0 m/s² so you should always be higher than that%n%nWhen your Rocket is ready, click Build on the Rocket Assembling Machine. You can then right click to board it or sneak + right click to open its inventories and check the fuel level.%n%nFinally, insert your Planet Id Chip in the Guidance Computer's inventory, then in the Rocket's inventory click Select Dst, select Luna either on the map or through the Planet List, and click Select.%n%nMake sure you have a full Space Suit (or full armor enchanted with Airtight Seal) filled with Oxygen, then board the Rocket and press Space. You will then arrive on Luna. To go back, select Earth like you selected Luna earlier, board the Rocket and take off again. You don't need as much fuel to take off from Luna.

The rocket will be lost, unless you give it a Guidance Computer with the Space Station ID Chip in it, in which case it'll land on the newly made Space Station.%n%nYou can travel there by making a Rocket, and placing the Space Station ID Chip in the Guidance Computer.§4 Make sure to always have backups of your Space Station ID Chip!

A seed grows into the corresponding Pure Crystal, which is substitutable for the original crystal in most recipes. Using Pure Crystals lets you effectively double your material efficiency, which is nice. And no, you can't grind down Pure Crystals to further multiply your resources. Sorry.%n%nFluix Crystals you've already had to make in a pool of water by now, and it's the same ingredients here: insert one each of a §6Redstone Dust§r, §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystal§r, and a §6Nether Quartz§r to produce two Fluix Crystals.

e2eu.quest.db.742.desc=If you've tried to insert or remove a lot of items quickly, you might notice your ME network%n§eflickers offline§r briefly. This is because digitizing and re-materializing items requires energy!%n%nYour network doesn't naturally store very much energy and the §6Energy Acceptor§r only intermittently refills the network's power. To keep things stable, you will need to add some energy storage in your network using §6Energy Cells§r.%n%nJust place one anywhere in your network and it will fill up with AE energy received from the Energy Acceptor. Now, you should have enough energy in your network to prevent these power losses. Feel free to add more energy cells, or upgrade to §6Dense Energy Cells§r, if you continue to experience problems.%n%nIf you've opted to enable channels in your AE2 configs, you will innately have some energy storage from the §3ME Controller§r, but we assume you know what you're doing at that point. §eAE2 Channels mechanics are outside the scope of the quest book, and this is the only time it will be mentioned.

# db 743
e2eu.quest.db.743.title=ME Cables
e2eu.quest.db.743.desc=These are the basic cables used by §3Applied Energistics§r to transport network connectivity. Due to the fact that channels are disabled, these cables will be your main method of transporting network connectivity, rather than the dense cables.%n%nThese cables do not share blockspace with conduits or cables for other mods, so they can be somewhat unweildy to build with, but they do accept §3Applied Energistics§r§6§r §6Facades§r, so they can be hidden very easily.%n%n§6ME Conduits§r have the advantage of being able to share a block space with other conduit types. Oh, and they're relatively cheaper to make.%n%nThe only downside is that §ethey will not connect to §bApplied Energistics§r §emicroparts§r like slab-form §6Interfaces§r or §6Level Emitters§r, so you have to use AE cables like §6Fluix Cable§r for those.%n

e2eu.quest.db.745.title=Energy Acceptor
e2eu.quest.db.745.desc=The §3Energy Acceptor§r converts RF power into AE power that Applied Energistics uses, in a 2 RF to 1 AE ratio. This power will be transmitted through adjacent full-block ME Network devices, as well as along all connected §6ME Cables§r, §6ME Conduits§r, and §6Quartz Fiber§r. %n%nQuartz Fiber are §emicroparts§r you can put between an ME Cable and any ME Network block or another ME Cable. This will allow transmission of AE power but not data, which is useful for having data-isolated ME Networks all sharing the same power source.

e2eu.quest.db.748.title=Advanced Inscriber
e2eu.quest.db.748.desc=§3Advanced Inscribers§r are much easier to work with for automation purposes, since you can insert more than a single item at a time and you can lock §aPresses§r in place.%n%nYou can automate these nicely with processing patterns in an §aME Interface§r. They don't auto-eject items though, so you will need to pull the finished items out.

# db 749
e2eu.quest.db.749.title=Digital Storage At Last
e2eu.quest.db.749.desc=§bApplied Energistics§r uses §6Storage Cells§r as its primary means of digital item and fluid storage.%n%nAll unformatted Storage Cells are limited to at most 63 distinct item types, with the first item of each new type taking up a chunk of the total bytes of cell storage, and subsequent items of existing types taking a small number of bytes thereafter.%n%nA §61k ME Storage Cell§r is the first and smallest cell for storing items. If you are going to be storing many different kinds of items in your network, you will need to make an §6ME Drive§r and fill it with multiple Storage Cells.%n%nCells come in many tiers, each being able to store 4 times as many bytes as the previous tier.

# db 752
e2eu.quest.db.752.title=ME interfaces
e2eu.quest.db.752.desc=§aME Interfaces§r are extremely important for automation. %n%nThese can be filled with encoded §aPatterns§r to perform on-demand autocrafting, and can be configured to stock up to 9 stacks of items for passive autocrafting, Any item pushed into an ME Interface is digitized and placed in your ME Network storage.%n%nWhen adjacent to one or more §aMolecular Assemblers§r, crafting table patterns can be crafted. It will use as many adjacent Molecular Assemblers as possible, restricted by availability and number of §aCo-processors§r in your crafting CPU multiblock.%n%nWhen adjacent to any other block, you can use processing patterns with a machine to insert items into the machine. Processing patterns require that the finished item is inserted back into the ME Network by way of an ME Interface (though it doesn't need to be the same ME Interface the Pattern is in).%n%nME Interfaces can be wrenched to ensure they only communicate with a particular adjacent block, or can be crafted into a micropart form to fit multiple in the same block space (each micropart only interacting with the adjacent block face).%n%n

e2eu.quest.db.756.title=Automating Extended Crafting
e2eu.quest.db.756.desc=With §bPackaged ExCrafting§r, or PEX, you can begin automating §bExtended Crafting§r recipes.%n%nTo begin, you'll need to craft one a extended §3Package Crafter§r, and put an §3Unpackager§r touching it.%n%nNext, right-click the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r, and you should see a button saying "Processing": this button cycles through recipe types, including the various Extended Crafting tables. You'll have to choose the appropriate table for the recipe you want to encode.%n%n§6Holders§r must be encoded in pairs: one for the Packager, and one for the Unpackager. Select the appropriate table for the recipe, look up the recipe you want to encode, and press §6[+]§r in §bJEI§r to fill it in. Put two Holders in the top-left slot and press Save to encode the recipe to both of them. Finally, put each Holder into the respective machines.%n%nIf you've done everything correctly, you should see the item appear as craftable in a Terminal.%n%nWhile it might seem that the crafting process is slow, §ePackagedAuto is excellent at parallelizing§r. You can surround an Unpackager with Crafters and it will use all of them. It's also possible to add more Unpackagers with Crafters to keep up with the Packager, as long as the Holders are all the same.%n%n

# db 757
e2eu.quest.db.757.title=PackagedAuto
e2eu.quest.db.757.desc=§bPackagedAuto§r is an addon for §bApplied Energistics 2§r. Its main purpose in §9E2E Unoffical§r is to allow you to automate §bExtended Crafting§r and §bAstral§r recipes, but you may come up with other fun uses for it as well.%n%nApplied Energistics 2 stores recipes in §aPatterns§r, but so far they have been limited to at most 9 stacks of items (a standard 3x3 crafting grid). PackagedAuto stores recipes in §aPackage Recipe Holders§r, which don't have this limitation. Additionally, each Holder can store up to §e20 different recipes§r. Holders must be encoded in the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r.%n%nIn the vast majority of situations you'll need two identically-encoded Holders, as the following machines work together.%n%nThe §3Packager§r is a machine that compresses ingredients for a specific recipe into a set of §6Recipe Packages§r. Each package in a set can hold up to 9 stacks of ingredient items. A simple recipe might consist of one package, but a complex recipe can have up to 9 packages in its set (for 81 total item stacks).%n%nThe §3Unpackager§r is a machine that extracts ingredient items from complete sets of Recipe Packages made in a Packager, ejecting the items into an adjacent inventory. It will only extract the items if §eall packages in a set are present§r.%n%nWhen both a Packager and Unpackager are connected to an ME Network and have the same recipe, the resulting item will appear as craftable in your §aTerminal§r.%n%n§3Packager Extensions§r will act like a clone of an adjacent Packager - including access to patterns in its Package Recipe Holder - allowing you to craft recipe packages faster. Simply place the Packager Extensions around the Packager. Up to 26 extensions in a 3x3x3 cube around the Packager are supported.

e2eu.quest.db.758.title=Autocrafting Patterns
e2eu.quest.db.758.desc=§aPatterns§r are used to encode a single crafting table or processing recipe for on-demand automation with §bApplied Energistics§r.%n%nEncode them in a §aPattern Terminal§r.%n%nNote that recipes encoded with Substitutions on will use existing equivalent items, but §ewill only automatically craft the exact item specified in the recipe.§r%n%nIt is also a §cvery bad idea§r to encode recipes that require hand tools (even worse with Substitutions on). They are not handled gracefully, causing your crafting computations to explode in complexity and memory requirement.%n%nUse recipes that use machines instead!%n%nWith that being said, go ahead and use your newly crafted autocrafting materals to set up autocrafting for patterns and interfaces, so you can have more of them at the press of a button!
